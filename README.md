## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox to position elements on the page. I also learned how to use CSS custom properties and how to use regex in JavaScript to validate the email address.

```js
const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions) - This helped me understand how to use regex in JavaScript.
